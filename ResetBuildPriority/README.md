## ResetBuildPriority

Tired of accidentally placing priority 9 structures several minutes after a crisis? Suffer from short-term memory loss?

This mod changes the behaviour of the build placement tool to reset its build priority to 5 when you leave it. This makes it consistent with the other tools, making it behave like the early ONI days.
