Debating on moving Sage Hatch from dark cave to here instead, and adding rock hatch to dark cave.

May be starter biome or very rare...

Should add pincha pepperplant, drecko, and another gas (hydrogen, propane, or nat gas, probably nat gas)?

#### Other ideas

Something that uses Ethanol or Petroleum as the liquid bodies. Need a hot, very hot, and very cold biome (maybe structure can be freezing since it will have really good items).
