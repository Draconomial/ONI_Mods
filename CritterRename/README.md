## CritterRename
Gives the ability to rename critters, both domestic and wild. Critter names will transfer to the next generation.

Princess Jr. and Mr. Wigglebutt VII are pleased.

## Naming Mechanic
You can name any critters (anything with the "Creature" tag). Critters transfer their names to their eggs (although hidden), and eggs transfer those names when they hatch to the new baby critter.

The original critter type will be shown as a subtitle.

## Generation Mechanic
The generation increments on an egg when it is laid. If the critter lays more than one egg, both eggs will have the same next generation name. The second generation will have a "Jr." suffix appended to the name, third generation and beyond use roman numerals.

For example, if you name a critter "Blinky", the generations will play out as follows:
Blinky -> Blinky Jr. -> Blinky III -> Blinky IV -> ...

## Known Bugs
- The edit tooltip says "Give this Duplicant a new name". The same tooltip is used for naming compactors as well so it's not specific to this mod.
- When an egg is selected and it hatches, the selected baby will show as unnamed, but it is actually named if you re-select it.
